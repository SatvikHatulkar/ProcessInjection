- # ProcessInjection
- **Hello everyone, I am Satvik Hatulkar, a cybersecurity student passionate about exploring the intricacies of system security and ethical hacking. Welcome to our series on process injection, an essential technique for red teaming and penetration testing. In this repository you will find various types of process injection techniques and there writeups.**
    - ## What is Shellcode Process Injection?
        - Process injection is a sophisticated method used to execute code within the address space of another process, allowing attackers to hide their activities and evade security measures.

    - ## Why Do We Need Payload Encryption?
        - Encrypted shellcode is employed to evade static detection. Static detection mechanisms search for signatures within the code to identify potential threats.

    - ## What is process hollowing?
        - Process hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process in a suspended state then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code.
